    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is a classic comfort food that consists of melted cheese between two slices of bread, typically toasted or grilled until golden brown and crispy. It's a simple yet delicious dish that can be customized with various types of cheese and additional ingredients like tomatoes, bacon, or avocado.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread (white, whole wheat, sourdough, etc.)</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons butter or margarine</li>
        <li>Optional: additional ingredients like tomato slices, cooked bacon, avocado, or mustard</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <li>Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, onto the skillet.</li>

        <li>Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, or until the bread is golden brown and the cheese starts to melt.</li>

        <li>Remove the sandwich from the skillet and let it cool for a minute before slicing in half.</li>
