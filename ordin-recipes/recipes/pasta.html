    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy, garlicky pasta is ready in less than 15 minutes and SO easy to throw together! If you want quick comfort food, look no further!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>pasta (spaghetti, penne, fettuccine, etc.)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream or whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
        <li>chicken breast, bacon, or other meat</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter or heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the flour over the garlic and stir well to combine. Cook for about 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the chicken or vegetable broth, followed by the heavy cream or whole milk. Continue to whisk until the mixture is smooth and starts to thicken, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until melted and the sauce is creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If using, add cooked chicken breast, bacon, or other meat at this stage.</li>
        <li>Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to heat everything through.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
