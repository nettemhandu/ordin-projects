# Welcome to my collection of projects from The Odin Project (TOP) 
*A free, open-source course that teaches web development by building things from scratch.*

*Through structured lessons, real-world projects, and lots of trial and error, I’m sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond. Each folder here is a snapshot of my journey — sometimes messy, always hands-on, and steadily moving me closer to becoming a full-stack developer.*
